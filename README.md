This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in COBOL related to data handling.  The program appears straightforward but can produce unexpected results depending on the length of data being moved between storage areas. The solution file provides a corrected version with improved data handling practices.  This is a useful example to highlight the importance of precise data management in COBOL.
